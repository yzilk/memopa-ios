## 🚀 Philosophy

> **"Tactile experience over feature bloating."**

By bridging the gap between SwiftUI and UIKit, Memopa achieves a level of interaction density that standard components can't reach. Every millisecond of delay and every vibration is tuned to make writing feel **effortless and magical**.
